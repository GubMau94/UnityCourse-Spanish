# UnityCourse-Spanish : 
It is a folder where I store all the projects done during the course.
Some of them have been done with the teacher at the same time (projects) and others alone (challenges). 
Inside the projects folder, the only one that I have worked even more, after the end of the lesson, is the one called "BallChaser" that I have added features like particles effects, joystick and buttons to play by phone, score and wave system.
